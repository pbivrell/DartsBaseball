This is a Simple Java based HTTP Server built to keep score for the Darts Basesball.

- Baseball Logic is implemented in the src/Baseball.java 
- Server Logic is implemented in SimpleHTTPSever.java \*This is my first attempt at a java base http server. I am not happy with the code but it works for now.
