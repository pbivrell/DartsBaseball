This is a Simple Java based HTTP Server built to keep score for the Darts Basesball.

- Baseball Logic is implemented in the src/Baseball.java 
- Server Logic is implemented in src/SimpleHTTPSever.java 
\*This is my first attempt at a java base http server. I am not happy with the code but it works for now.\*

TODO
- Add Baseball start webpage
- Rewrite HTTP Server so post request gets proper reasponse back
